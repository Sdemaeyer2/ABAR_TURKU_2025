title: "About me"
---

I'm an `R`-enthusiast teaching statistics for behavioral researchers from an applied point of view. My main mission is to get people enthusiastic on the wonderful world of statistics. 

In 2020, I started deep-diving into the world of Bayesian analyses during my sabbatical leave in full Covid times. The last 5 years I had the nice opportunity to share my learning with others in the form of different workshops (also here in Turku) and by writing some blog-posts to process what I learned myself.

One of my key values is that I'm also an advocate of Open Scholarship, sharing all research and teaching materials as open as possible for the broad (academic) audience. If you want to dive into my other materials and irregular blog-posts you can visit my website: [Sven's sharing place](https://sdemaeyer.quarto.pub/).
